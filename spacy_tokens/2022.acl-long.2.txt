Quantified Reproducibility Assessment of NLP Results Anya Belz and Maja Popović ADAPT Research Centre Dublin City University , Ireland { anya.belz,maja.popovic}@adaptcentre.ie Abstract clusions :
e.g. the four papers ( Arhiliuc et al. , 2020 ; Bestgen , 2020 ; Caines and Buttery , 2020 ; Huber and Çöltekin , 2020 ) reproducing Vajjala and Rama ( 2018 ) in REPROLANG all report similarly large differences , but only Arhiliuc et al. conclude that reproduction was unsuccessful .
There is no standard way of going about a reproduction study in NLP , and different reproduction studies of the same original set of results can differ substantially in terms of their similarity in system and/or evaluation design ( as is the case with the Vajjala and Rama ( 2018 ) reproductions , see Section 4 for details ) .
Other things being equal , a more similar reproduction can be expected to produce more similar results , and such ( dis)similarities should be factored into reproduction analysis and conclusions , but NLP lacks a method for doing so .
Being able to assess reproducibility of results objectively and comparably is important not only to establish that results are valid , but to provide evidence about which methods have better / worse reproducibility and what may need to be changed to improve reproducibility .
To do this , assessment has to be done in a way that is also comparable across reproduction studies of different original studies , e.g. to develop common expectations of how similar original and reproduction results should be for different types of system , task and evaluation .
In this paper , we ( i ) describe a method for quantified reproducibility assessment ( QRA ) directly derived from standard concepts and definitions from metrology which addresses the above issues , and ( ii ) test it on diverse sets of NLP results .
Following a review of related research ( Section 2 ) , we present the method ( Section 3 ) , tests and results ( Section 4 ) , discuss method and results ( Section 5 ) , and finish with some conclusions ( Section 6 ) .
This paper describes and tests a method for carrying out quantified reproducibility assessment ( QRA ) that is based on concepts and definitions from metrology .
QRA produces a single score estimating the degree of reproducibility of a given system and evaluation measure , on the basis of the scores from , and differences between , different reproductions .
We test QRA on 18 system and evaluation measure combinations ( involving diverse NLP tasks and types of evaluation ) , for each of which we have the original results and one to seven reproduction results .
The proposed QRA method produces degree - of - reproducibility scores that are comparable across multiple reproductions not only of the same , but of different original studies .
We find that the proposed method facilitates insights into causes of variation between reproductions , and allows conclusions to be drawn about what changes to system and/or evaluation design might lead to improved reproducibility .
1 Simon Mille Universitat Pompeu Fabra Barcelona , Spain simon.mille@upf.edu Introduction Reproduction studies are becoming more common in Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) , with the first shared tasks being organised , including REPROLANG ( Branco et al. , 2020 ) and ReproGen ( Belz et al. , 2021b ) .
In NLP , reproduction studies generally address the following question : if we create and/or evaluate this system multiple times , will we obtain the same results ?
To answer this question for a given specific system , typically ( Wieling et al. , 2018 ; Arhiliuc et al. , 2020 ; Popović and Belz , 2021 ) an original study is selected and repeated more or less closely , before comparing the results obtained in the original study with those obtained in the repeat , and deciding whether the two sets of results are similar enough to support the same conclusions .
This framing , whether the same conclusions can be drawn , involves subjective judgments and different researchers can come to contradictory con 2 Related Research
The situation memorably caricatured by Pedersen ( 2008 ) still happens all the time : you download 16 Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Volume 1 : Long Papers , pages 16 - 28 May 22 - 27 , 2022 c 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics  some code you read about in a paper and liked the sound of , you run it on the data provided , only to find that the results are not the same as reported in the paper , in fact they are likely to be worse ( Belz et al. , 2021a ) .
When both data and code are provided , the number of potential causes of such differences is limited , and the NLP field has shared increasingly detailed information about system , dependencies and evaluation to chase down sources of differences .
Sharing code and data together with detailed information about them is now expected as standard , and checklists and datasheets have been proposed to standardise information sharing ( Pineau , 2020 ; Shimorina and Belz , 2021 ) .
Whitaker ( 2017 ) , followed by Schloss ( 2018 ) , defines four concepts rather than two , basing definitions of reproducibility , replicability , robustness and generalisability on the different possible combinations of same vs. different data and code .
None of these definitions adopt the general scientific concepts and definitions pertaining to reproducibility , codified in the International Vocabulary of Metrology , VIM ( JCGM , 2012 ) .
One issue is that they all reduce the in principle open - ended number of dimensions of variation between measurements accounted for by VIM to just two or three ( code , data and/or team ) .
Another , that unlike VIM , they do n’t produce comparable results .
NLP does not currently have a shared approach to deciding reproducibility , and results from reproductions as currently reported are not comparable across studies and can , as mentioned in the introduction , lead to contradictory conclusions about an original study ’s reproducibility .
There appears to be no work at all in NLP that aims to estimate degree of reproducibility which would allow crossstudy comparisons and conclusions .
Reproducibility more generally is becoming more of a research focus .
There have been several workshops and initiatives on reproducibility , including workshops at ICML 2017 and 2018 , the reproducibility challenge at ICLR 2018 and 2019 , and at NeurIPS 2019 and 2020 , the REPROLANG ( Branco et al. , 2020 ) initiative at LREC 2020 , and the ReproGen shared task on reproducibility in NLG ( Belz et al. , 2021b ) .
Despite this growing body of research , no consensus has emerged about standards , terminology and definitions .
Particularly for the two most frequently used terms , reproducibility and replicability , multiple divergent definitions are in use , variously conditioned on same vs. different teams , methods , artifacts , code , and data .
For example , for Rougier et al. ( 2017 ) , reproducing a result means running the same code on the same data and obtaining the same result , while replicating the result is writing and running new code based on the information provided by the original publication .
For Wieling et al. ( 2018 ) , reproducibility is achieving the same results using the same data and methods .
3 Metrology - based Reproducibility Assessment Metrology is a meta - science : its subject is the standardisation of measurements across all of science to ensure comparability .
Computer science has long borrowed terms , most notably reproducibility , from metrology , albeit not adopting the same definitions ( as discussed in Section 2 above ) .
In this section , we describe quantified reproducibility assessment ( QRA ) , an approach that is directly derived from the concepts and definitions of metrology , adopting the latter exactly as they are , and yields assessments of the degree of similarity between numerical results and between the studies that produced them .
We start below with the concepts and definitions that QRA is based on , followed by an overview of the framework ( Section 3.2 ) and steps in applying it in practice ( Section 3.3 ) .
According to the ACM ’s definitions ( Association for Computing Machinery , 2020 ) , results have been reproduced if obtained in a different study by a different team using artifacts supplied in part by the original authors , and replicated if obtained in a different study by a different team using artifacts not supplied by the original authors .
The ACM originally had these definitions the other way around until asked by ISO to bring them in line with the scientific standard ( ibid . ) .
3.1 VIM Definitions of Repeatability and Reproducibility The International Vocabulary of Metrology ( VIM ) ( JCGM , 2012 ) defines repeatability and reproducibility as follows ( defined terms in bold , see VIM for subsidiary defined terms ):
Conversely , in Drummond ’s view 2009 obtaining the same result by re - running an experiment in the same way as the original is replicability , while reproducibility is obtaining it in a different way .
2.21 measurement repeatability ( or repeatability , 17  for short ) is measurement precision under a set of repeatability conditions of measurement .
of variation is used as the precision measure , but other measures are possible .
Conditions of measurement are attribute / value pairs each consisting of a name and a value ( for examples , see following section ) .
Reproducibility R is defined in the same way as R0 except that condition values ( but not names ) differ for one or more of the conditions of measurement Ci : 2.20 a repeatability condition of measurement ( repeatability condition ) is a condition of measurement , out of a set of conditions that includes the same measurement procedure , same operators , same measuring system , same operating conditions and same location , and replicate measurements on the same or similar objects over a short period of time .
R(M1 , M2 , ... Mn ) : = Precision(v1 , v2 , ... vn ) , where Mi : ( m , O , ti , Ci ) 7→ vi Precision is typically reported in terms of some or all of the following : mean , standard deviation with 95 % confidence intervals , coefficient of variation , and percentage of measured quantity values within n standard deviations .
We opt for the coefficient of variation ( CV),1 because it is a general measure , not in the unit of the measurements ( unlike mean and standard deviation ) , providing a quantification of precision ( degree of reproducibility ) that is comparable across studies ( Ahmed , 1995 , p. 57 ) .
This also holds for percentage within n standard deviations but the latter is a less recognised measure , and likely to be the less intuitive for many .
In reproduction studies in NLP / ML , sample sizes tend to be very small ( a sample size of 8 , one original study plus 7 reproductions , as in Table 6 is currently unique ) .
We therefore need to use de - biased sample estimators : we use the unbiased sample standard deviation , denoted s∗ , with confidence intervals calculated using a t - distribution , and standard error ( of the unbiased sample standard deviation ) approximated on the basis of the standard error of the unbiased sample variance se(s2 )
as 1 ses2 ( s∗ )
≈ 2σ se(s2 ) ( Rao , 1973 ) .
Assuming measured quantity values are normally distributed , we calculate the standard errorq of the sample variance 2.25 measurement reproducibility ( reproducibility ) is measurement precision under reproducibility conditions of measurement .
2.24 a reproducibility condition of measurement ( reproducibility condition ) is a condition of measurement , out of a set of conditions that includes different locations , operators , measuring systems , etc .
A specification should give the conditions changed and unchanged , to the extent practical .
In other words , VIM considers repeatability and reproducibility to be properties of measurements ( not objects , scores , results or conclusions ) , and defines them as measurement precision , i.e. both are quantified by calculating the precision of a set of measured quantity values .
Both concepts are defined relative to a set of conditions of measurement : the conditions have to be known and specified for assessment of repeatability and reproducibility to be meaningful .
In repeatability , conditions are the same , whereas in reproducibility , they differ .
In an NLP context , objects are systems , and measurements involve applying an evaluation method to a system usually via obtaining a sample of its outputs and applying the method to the sample ( further details of how concepts map to NLP are provided in Section 3.3 ) .
4 2σ in the usual way : se(s2 ) =
n−1 .
Finally , we also use a small sample correction ( indicated by the star ) 1 for the coefficient of variation : CV∗ = ( 1 + 4n ) CV 2 ( Sokal and Rohlf , 1971 ) .
Before applying CV∗ to values on scales that do not start at 0 ( mostly in human evaluations ) we shift values to start at 0 to ensure comparability.3
This means that to calculate the CV∗ scores in the tables below , measurements are first shifted .
3.2 Assessment framework The VIM definitions translate directly to the following definition of repeatability R0 ( where all conditions of measurement C are the same across measurements ): R0 ( M1 , M2 , ... Mn ) :
= Precision(v1 , v2 , ... vn ) , where Mi : ( m , O , ti , C ) 7→ vi ( 2 ) ( 1 ) 1
The coefficient of variation ( CV ) , also known as relative standard deviation ( RSD ) is defined as the standard deviation over the mean , often expressed as a percentage .
2 Code and data are available here : https://github . com / asbelz / coeff - var . 3
Otherwise CV∗ reflects differences solely due to different lower ends of scales .
and the Mi are repeat measurements for measurand m performed on object O at different times ti under ( the same ) set of conditions C , producing measured quantity values vi .
Below , the coefficient 18  3.3 Application of the framework discover every aspect and detail of how a measurement was performed , so a reduced set may have to be used ( unlike in experiments designed to test reproducibility where such details can be gathered as part of the experimental design ) .
The reproducibility and evaluation checklists mentioned in Section 2 ( Pineau , 2020 ; Shimorina and Belz , 2021 ) capture properties that are in effect conditions of measurement , and in combination with code , data and other resources serve well as a way of specifying conditions of measurement , if they have been completed by authors .
However , at the present time , completed checklists are not normally available .
The following is a simple set of conditions of measurement the information required for which is typically available for existing work ( we include object and measurand for completeness although strictly they are not conditions , as they must be the same in each measurement in a given QRA test ):
Using the defined VIM terms and the notations from Section 3.2 , we can refine the question from the start of this paper as follows : if we perform multiple measurements of object O and measurand m under reproducibility conditions of measurement Ci , what is the precision of the measured quantity values we obtain ?
For NLP , this means calculating the precision of multiple evaluation scores for the same system and evaluation measure .
Focusing here on reproducibility assessment where we start from an existing set of results ( rather than a set of experiments specifically designed to test reproducibility ) , the steps in performing QRA are as follows :
1 .
For a set of n measurements to be assessed , identify the shared object and measurand .
2 . Identify all conditions of measurement Ci for which information is available for all measurements , and specify values for each condition , including measurement method and procedure .
1 . Object : the system ( variant ) being evaluated.4 E.g. a given MT system .
2 . Measurand : the quantity intended to be evaluated.5 E.g. BLEU - style n - gram precision or human - assessed Fluency .
3 . Gather the n measured quantity values v1 , v2 , ... vn .
3 . Object conditions : 4 . Compute precision for v1 , v2 , ... vn , giving reproducibility score R. ( a ) System code : source code including any parameters .
E.g. the complete code implementing an MT system .
5 . Report resulting R score and associated confidence statistics , alongside the Ci .
( b ) Compile / training information : steps from code plus parameters to fully compiled and trained system , including dependencies and environment .
E.g. complete information about how the MT system code was compiled and the system trained .
In NLP terms , the object is the ready - to - use system ( binaries if available ; otherwise code , dependencies , parameter values , how the system was compiled and trained ) being evaluated ( e.g. the NTSdefault system variant in Table 1 ) , the measurand is the quantity intended to be measured ( e.g. BLEUstyle modified n - gram precision ) , and measurement method and procedure capture how to evaluate the system ( e.g. obtaining system outputs for a specified set of inputs , and applying preprocessing and a given BLEU implementation to the latter ) .
VIM holds that reproducibility assessment is only meaningful if the reproducibility conditions of measurement are specified for a given test .
Conditions of measurement cover every aspect and detail of how a measurement was performed and how the measured quantity value was obtained .
The key objective is to capture all respects in which the measurements to be assessed are known to be either the same or different .
If QRA is performed for a set of existing results , it is often not possible to 4 .
Measurement method conditions:6 ( a ) Method specification : full description of method used for obtaining values quantifying the measurand .
E.g. a formal definition of BLEU .
( b ) Implementation : the method implemented in a form that can be applied to the object in order to obtain measured quantity values .
E.g. a full implementation of BLEU .

There are three sets of related systems : ( i ) the ( single ) PASS football report generator ( van der Lee et al. , 2017 ) , ( ii ) Vajjala and Rama ( 2018 ) ’s 11 multilingual essay scoring system variants , and ( iii ) two variants of Nisioi et al. ( 2017 ) ’s neural text simplifier ( NTS ) .
PASS is evaluated with three evaluation measures ( human - assessed Clarity , Fluency and Stance Identifiability ) , the essay scoring systems with one ( weighted F1 ) , and the NTS systems with two ( BLEU and SARI ) .
For PASS we have one reproduction study , for the essay scorers seven , and for the NTS systems , from three to six .
The PASS reproduction was carried out as part of ReproGen ( Belz et al. , 2021b ) , the reproductions of the essay - scoring systems and of one of the NTS systems as part of REPROLANG ( Branco et al. , 2020 ) , and we carried out an additional reproduction study of the NTS systems for this paper.8 The PASS text generation system is rule - based , the essay classifiers are ‘ theory - guided and datadriven ’ hybrids , and the text simplifiers are end - toend neural systems .

green / lighter shading and italics ) , but differ by up to 1.4 points for BLEU ( scores highlighted by blue / darker shading ) .
Because Test set = Nisioi et al. in all cases , the differences in these BLEU scores can only be caused by differences in BLEU scripts and how they were run .
The corresponding CV∗ is as big as 0.838 for ( just ) the four NTS_def BLEU scores , and 1.314 for ( just ) the three NTS - w2v_def BLEU scores , reflecting known problems with nonstandardised BLEU scripts ( Post , 2018 ) .
If we conversely look just at those measurements ( identifiable by boldfaced measured quantity values in Table 5 ) where the reproducing team regenerated outputs ( with the same system code ) and evaluation scripts were the same , SARI CV∗ is 3.11 for the NTS_def variants , and 4.05 for the NTS - w2v_def variants ( compared in both cases to 0 ( perfect ) when the same outputs are used ) .
BLEU CV∗ is 2.154 for the NTS_def variants ( compared to 0.838 for same outputs but different evaluation scripts , as above ) , and 6.598 for the NTS - w2v_def variants ( compared to 1.314 for same outputs but different evaluation scripts ) .
These differences arise simply from running the system in different environments .
The overall higher ( worse ) CV∗ values for NTSw2v_def variants ( compared to NTS_def ) are likely to be partly due to the NTS models using one third party tool ( openNMT ) , and the NTS - w2v models using two ( openNMT and word2vec ) , i.e. the latter are more susceptible to changes in dependencies .
4.1 QRA for NTS systems
The neural text simplification systems reported by Nisioi et al. ( 2017 ) were evaluated with BLEU ( n - gram similarity between outputs and multiple reference texts ) and SARI ( based on word added / retained / deleted in outputs compared to both inputs and reference texts , summing over addition and retention F - scores and deletion Precisions ) .
Table 4 shows BLEU and SARI scores for the two system variants from the original paper and the two reproduction studies , alongside the four corresponding CV∗ values .
In their reproduction , Cooper and Shardlow ( 2020 ) regenerated test outputs for NTS - w2v_def , but not for NTS_def , which explains the missing scores in Column 4 .
The different numbers of scores in different rows in Columns 6–9 are due to our own reproduction using Nisioi et al. ’s SARI script , but two different BLEU scripts : ( i )
Nisioi et al. ’s script albeit with the tokeniser replaced by our own because the former did not work due to changes in the NLTK library ; and ( ii ) SacreBLEU ( Xu et al. , 2016 ) .
Table 5 shows the conditions of measurement for each of the 22 individual measurements .

Columns 6–9 show the corresponding sample size ( number of reproductions plus original study ) , mean , standard deviation ( stdev ) , the confidence interval ( CI ) for the standard deviation , and CV∗ , all calculated on the shifted scores ( see Section 3.2 ) .
The PASS system , developed by van der Lee et al. ( 2017 ) , generates football match reports from the perspective of each of the competing teams .
The original study evaluated the system for Clarity , Fluency and Stance Identifiability in an evaluation with 20 evaluators and a test set of 10 output pairs .
The evaluation was repeated with a slightly different evaluation interface and a different cohort of evaluators by Mille et al. ( 2021 ) .
Table 2 shows the results from the original and reproduction evaluations ( columns 3 and 4 ) , where the Clarity and Fluency results are the mean scores from 7 - point agreement Table 3 shows the values ( here , paper identifiers ) for the nine conditions of measurement introduced in Section 3.3 , for each of the six individual measurements ( three evaluation measures times two studies ) .
Note that both object conditions and the 22  dom and mult - emb variants all have similar CV∗ .9
The indication is that the syntactic information is obtained / used in a way that is particularly reproducible , whereas the domain - specific information and the embeddings are obtained / used in a way that is particularly hard to reproduce .
Overall , the random forest models using syntactic features have the best reproducibility ; the logistic regressors using domain - specific features have the worst .
test set condition are the same , because Mille et al. used the system outputs shared by van der Lee et al.
The values for the Implemented by , Procedure and Performed by conditions reflect the differences in the two evaluations in design , evaluator cohorts , and the teams that performed them .
The scores vary to different degrees for the three measurands , with CV∗ lowest ( reproducibility best ) for Stance Identifiability , and highest ( worst ) for Fluency .
These CV∗ results are likely to reflect that evaluators agreed more on Clarity than Fluency .
Moreover , the binary stance identification assessment has better reproducibility than the other two criteria which are assessed on 7 - point rating scales .
5 Discussion Quantified reproducibility assessment ( QRA ) enables assessment of the degree of reproducibility of evaluation results for any given system and evaluation measure in a way that is scale - invariant10 and comparable across different QRAs , for reproductions involving either the same or different original studies .
Moreover , formally capturing ( dis)similarities between systems and evaluation designs enables reproducibility to be assessed relative to such ( dis)similarities .
In combination , a set of results from QRA tests for the same system and evaluation measure can provide pointers to which aspects of the system and evaluation might be associated with low reproducibility .
E.g. for the wF1 evaluations of the essay scoring systems above , it is clear that variations in reproducibility are associated at least in part with the different features used by systems .
It might be expected that the reproducibility of human - assessed evaluations is generally worse than metric - assessed .
Our study revealed a more mixed picture .
As expected , the Fluency and Clarity evaluations of the PASS system were among those with highest CV∗ , and the BLEU and SARI evaluation of the NTS systems and wF1 evaluation of the mult - POS and mult - dep systems were among those with lowest CV∗ .
However , human - assessed Stance Identifiability of PASS was among the most reproducible , and metric - assessed wF1 of mult - base , mult - dom and mult - emb were among the worst .
In this paper , our focus has been QRA testing of existing research results .
However , ideally , QRA would be built into new method development from the outset , where at first reporting , a detailed stan 4.3 QRA for essay scoring system variants
The 11 multilingual essay scoring system variants reported by Vajjala and Rama ( 2018 ) were evaluated by weighted F1 ( wF1 ) score .
Table 6 shows wF1 scores for the 11 multilingual system variants from each of the five papers , alongside the 11 corresponding CV∗ values .
Table 7 in the appendix shows the corresponding conditions of measurement .
The baseline classifier ( mult - base ) uses document length ( number of words ) as its only feature .
For the other variants , + /- indicates that the multilingual classifier was / was not given information about which language the input was in ; the multword variants use word n - grams only ; mult - word uses POS ( part of speech ) tag n - grams only ; multdep uses n - grams over dependency relation , dependent POS , and head POS triples ; mult - dom uses domain - specific linguistic features including document length , lexical richness and errors ; mult - emb uses word and character embeddings .
The multbase and mult - dom models are logistic regressors , the others are random forests .
A very clear picture emerges : system variant pairs that differ only in whether they do or do not use language information have very similar CV scores .
For example , mult - POS− ( POS n - grams without language information ) and mult - POS+ ( POS n - grams with language information ) both have a very good degree of wF1 - reproducibility , their CV∗ being 3.818 and 3.808 respectively ; multword− ( word n - grams without language information ) and mult - word+ ( word n - grams with language information ) have notably higher CV∗ , around 10 .
This tendency holds for all such pairs , indicating that using language information makes next to no difference to reproducibility .
Moreover , the mult The high CV∗ for the baseline system may be due to an issue wiith the evaluation code ( macro - F1 instead of weightedF1 ) , as reported by Bestgen ( Section 3.2 , first paragraph ) , Caines and Buttery ( Section 2.5 , one before last paragraph ) and Huber and Çöltekin ( Section 3.2 , second paragraph ) .

If evaluation scores are multiplied by a common factor , CV∗ does not change .

dardised set of conditions of measurement is specified , and repeatability tests ( where all conditions are identical except for the team conducting the tests , see Section 3.2 ) are performed to determine baseline reproducibility .
Such repeatability QRA would provide quality assurance for new methods as well as important pointers for future reproductions regarding what degree of reproducibility to expect for given ( types of ) methods .
If this is not possible , post - hoc reproducibility QRA ( where there are differences in conditions of measurement values ) is performed instead .
If this yields high ( poor ) CV∗ , one way to proceed is to minimise differences in conditions of measurement between the studies and observe the effect on CV∗ , changing aspects of system and evaluation design and adding further conditions of measurement if need be .
For human evaluation in particular , persistently high CV∗ would indicate a problem with the method itself .
between reproductions , produces results that are comparable across different reproducibility assessments , and provides pointers about what needs to be changed in system and/or evaluation design to improve reproducibility .
6 We are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and area chairs for their exceptionally detailed and helpful feedback .
A recent survey ( Belz et al. , 2021a ) found that just 14 % of the 513 original / reproduction score pairs analysed were exactly the same .
Judging the remainder simply ‘ not reproduced ’ is of limited usefulness , as some are much closer to being the same than others .
At the same time , assessments of whether the same conclusions can be drawn on the basis of different scores involve subjective judgments and are prone to disagreement among assessors .
Quantifying the closeness of results as in QRA , and , over time , establishing expected levels of closeness , seems a better way forward .
Acknowledgements Conclusion We have described an approach to quantified reproducibility assessment ( QRA ) based on concepts and definitions from metrology , and tested it on 18 system and evaluation measure combinations involving diverse NLP tasks and types of evaluation .
QRA produces a single score that quantifies the degree of reproducibility of a given system and evaluation measure , on the basis of the scores from , and differences between , multiple reproductions of the same original study .
We found that the approach facilitates insights into sources of variation Popović ’s work on this s study was funded by the ADAPT SFI Centre for Digital Media Technology which is funded by Science Foundation Ireland through the SFI Research Centres Programme , and co - funded under the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) through Grant 13 / RC/2106 .
