Motivation and Objectives other researchers and NLP practitioners on the importance and challenges of developing multilingual T O D systems .
The tutorial will offer a comprehensive overview of multilingual T O D research and know - hows focused on the following central questions:2 Enabling machines to intelligently converse with humans in order to solve particular well - defined tasks is in the core focus of task - oriented dialogue ( T O D ) systems and their development ( Kim and Banchs , 2014 ; Li et al. , 2018 ; Henderson et al. , 2019 ; Zang et al. , 2020 ) .
Such systems have wide applications in a multitude of domains such as hospitality industry , travel , e - banking , healthcare , entertainment industry , industrial production and maintenance , etc .
T O D - oriented research has been recently catalysed by the growing ability and viability of deep learning techniques such as largescale pretraining of language models ( Ren et al. , 2018 ; Wen et al. , 2019 ; Henderson et al. , 2020 ; Wu et al. , 2020 ; Lin et al. , 2020 , inter alia ) .
The momentum of development in this research area has , however , mainly targeted a very small proportion of potential beneficiaries : most existing T O D systems are predominantly built for English and a few other , major languages only ( e.g. , Chinese ) ( Lin et al. , 2021 ; Ding et al. , 2021 ) .
This limits the use , global reach , and transformative potential of T O D systems .
Consequently , this deepens the chasm between speakers of dominant versus underrepresented low - resource languages in their access to state - of - the - art language technology ( Joshi et al. , 2020 ; Blasi et al. , 2021 ) and contributes to the digital language divide and inequality of information.1 Extending the reach of T O D technology is crucial for the democratisation and wide adoption of human – machine communication , with an inclusive long - term goal of bringing it to virtually all citizens of the world .
Building on top of our recent comprehensive survey on the topic of multilingual T O D ( Razumovskaia et al. , 2021 ) , in this tutorial our aim is to systematise the current research on multilingual T O D , and offer a fresh perspective to ( Q1 )
Why are multilingual T O D systems so hard to build ?
What are the main roadblocks and how can we facilitate their development ?
What are the main design paradigms of multilingual T O D ?
( Q2 )
Which T O D datasets are currently available in one or more languages other than English ?
What are their strengths and weaknesses ?
How can we improve the current data design and collection efforts and protocols ?
( Q3 )
What are the best methods and practices to incorporate language - specific information and perform target language adaptation for multilingual and cross - lingual T O D ?
( Q4 )
How can multilingual T O D take inspiration from other related fields of NLP research to better tackle low - resource scenarios ( e.g. , cross - lingual transfer , injection of external knowledge into parameters of neural models ) ?
( Q5 )
How good are current ( multilingual )
T O D systems ?
Do automatic evaluation measures correlate with user satisfaction ?
What implication does multilinguality have on T O D evaluation ?
( Q6 )
What are the future challenges faced when developing T O D systems in several different languages , especially with respect to voice - based and human - centered T O D ?
2 Tutorial Overview and Structure Part I : Introduction , Motivation , and T O D Preliminaries ( 25 minutes ) 1 http://labs.theguardian.com/ digital - language - divide/ 2
All tutorial materials will be available at https:// tinyurl.com/multilingualtod 44 Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics : Tutorial Abstracts , pages 44 - 50 May 22 - 27 , 2022 © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics  Part I will cover the basics of modular and end - toend dialogue systems ( Young , 2010 ; Chen et al. , 2017a ; Wen et al. , 2017 ; Ham et al. , 2020 ) , offering a brief overview of the full T O D system structure , and critical modules such as Speech - totext / ASR , natural language understanding ( NLU ) for dialogue , dialogue state tracking ( DST ) , dialogue management ( DM ) , natural language generation ( NLG ) , and text - to - speech ( TTS ) , along with their functionality .
We will analyse which components require language - specific processing and adaptation , and which modules are generally language - invariant .
We will then proceed to define the detailed scope and schedule of the tutorial .
Concretely , we plan to list and discuss all the current problems and challenges related to multilingual T O D development , and how we will introduce them in the subsequent tutorial parts .
Topics overview : • Main modules of T O D systems ; • Modular versus end - to - end T O D ; • Text - based ( vs. other ) T O D modules ; • Language - invariant vs. language - specific T O D modules ; • Why is development of multilingual T O D systems so difficult ?

Part III :
Methods and Resources for Multilingual NLG in T O D ( 35 minutes )
Part III will present the methods for multilingual natural language generation and their usage for cross - lingual transfer of T O D. First , we will discuss traditional , grammar - based methods for cross - lingual generation ( Gatt and Krahmer , 2018 ; Vaudry and Lapalme , 2013 ) and their combination with statistical methods ( García - Méndez et al. , 2019 ) for more efficient learning .
Secondly , we will discuss cross - lingual transfer of T O D using machine translation ( MT ) in two ways : a ) translating the test data into English ( ‘ translate test ’ , Wan et al. , 2010 ) ; b ) translating the training data into the target language ( ‘ translate train ’ , Duan et al. , 2019 ) , and how improvements in MT and multilingual pretraining affect cross - lingual transfer of T O D. Next , we will analyse the choice between retrieval - based , generation - based and hybrid T O D systems through the prism of multilinguality .
Finally , we will address the difficulties of corpora creation for multilingual T O D generation .
Topics : • Traditional NLG and its extension to multiple languages ; • Retrieval - based versus generation - based versus hybrid approaches : pros and cons in multilingual setups ; • Leveraging shared cross - lingual representation spaces for multilingual NLG ; translationbased approaches ; • Zero - shot and few - shot learning scenarios and language - specific adaptations ; • Available resources and datasets for multilingual NLG ( for T O D ) .
Part II :
Methods and Resources for Multilingual NLU in T O D ( 50 minutes )
Part II will cover to - date work in multilingual NLU in ToD , including standard approaches and recent trends .
We will provide a comprehenstive overview of methods for learning cross - lingual representation spaces in ToD ( Liu et al. , 2019 ; Siddhant et al. , 2020 ; Liu et al. , 2020 ; Moghe et al. , 2021 ) and their applications in different setups ( multilingual vs. cross - lingual , zero - shot vs. few - shot ) .
Finally , we will list available resources : those created specifically for multilingual ToD NLU ( Ding et al. , 2021 ; Zuo et al. , 2021 ; Hung et al. , 2022 , inter alia ) as well as external resources useful for ToD NLU .
Part II comprises the following topics : • Joint versus separate training for NLU : intent detection , slot labeling , DST ; • Learning shared cross - lingual representation spaces ; from cross - lingual word embeddings to multilingual text encoders – how to leverage them for NLU in T O D ?
•
Multilingual ( pre)training versus cross - lingual transfer methods ; • Zero - shot and few - shot learning scenarios ; • Datasets and resources : ( a ) for in - task dialogue training and ( b ) external resources ( e.g. , Part IV : Evaluation of Multilingual T O D Systems ( 30 minutes )
Part IV will focus on evaluation for ( multilingual ) T O D. We will cover both automatic metrics and human evaluation : automatic metrics allow for faster development cycles , but often do not correlate with user satisfaction with T O D systems ( Liu et al. , 2016 ; Novikova et al. , 2017 ) .
We will discuss the shortcomings of automated T O D evaluation , but also the potential pitfalls of human evaluation ( Clark et al. , 2021 ) .
We will then analyse the difficulties that multilingual setups pose for both automatic metrics and human evaluation , including evaluation of generated responses in morpho45  • Fluency of generation , code switching ; • From text - based to voice - based multilingual T O D : promises and challenges ; • An overview of other related research areas that can benefit multilingual T O D ; • Listing key challenges , a short panel discussion and a QA session .
logically rich languages and difficulty of finding qualified evaluators for rare languages .
Topics : • Current evaluation protocols in T O D ; • Automatic vs. human - centered evaluation in multilingual setups : pros and cons ; • How to evaluate language - specific phenomena and fluency ; • Difficulties in evaluation and current gaps in evaluation resources .
3 Part V : Open Challenges and Research Directions in Multilingual T O D ( 40 minutes )
In the concluding Part V , we will discuss the main open challenges impeding the development of T O D systems and reflect on the promising avenues for further progress .
First , we will advocate for linguistically motivated design of multilingual T O D datasets focusing on linguistic diversity and idiomacity .
To fulfill their role as gauges of model performance across languages ( Hu et al. , 2020 ; Liang et al. , 2020 ) , multilingual datasets should ( i ) maximise diversity along the dimensions of language family , geographic area , and typological features ( Ponti et al. , 2020 ) .
as well as ( ii ) adequately represent the linguistic and extra - linguistic ( e.g. , world knowledge , cultural references ) properties of selected languages ( rather than replicating dialogue structures , topics , and entities from a resource - rich source language ) .
We will discuss first attempts at cultural adaptation for dialogue ( Majewska et al. , 2022 ) .
Second , we will outline how existing strategies for dealing with data scarcity can be borrowed from other NLP tasks to benefit multilingual and cross - lingual T O D NLU ( Ponti et al. , 2019 ; Hedderich et al. , 2021 ) .
Third , we will emphasise the importance of user - centered evaluation as a way of assessing the fluency of generated responses and guiding improvements in ToD systems across different languages .
Finally , we will discuss the significance of developments in multilingual ASR and TTS as keys to the ultimate success of multilingual ToD on a wide scale , and the potential of integrating speech - based and text - based modules in future research .
Topics : Tutorial Breadth and Diversity According to the representative set of papers listed in the selected bibliography as well as in our recent survey paper ( Razumovskaia et al. , 2021 ) , we anticipate that a total of 20%-25 % of the tutorial concerns work which involves at least one of the five presenters .
The rest of the tutorial will focus on providing a detailed comprehensive overview of the main topic by covering all the relevant work from other researchers : see again the wide bibliography and coverage in the survey paper .
Diversity and Inclusion .
We consider the following aspects .
First , our tutorial proposal focuses on multilingual NLP and promotes the ultimate long - term goal of NLP research : bringing ( humancentered ) language technology to minor and underresourced languages , and acting as a vehicle of mitigating the digital language divide ( see the footnote 1 ) .
As such , it is highly relevant to both special themes of ACL 2022 and NAACL - HLT 2022 .
Our tutorial will also expose prominent issues and gaps related to ( lack of ) diversity and inclusivity of current multilingual T O D models and datasets , and we hope to inspire research groups currently working separately on ( i ) T O D and ( ii ) low - resource languages and low - resource NLP to consider joining forces and research expertise in the future .
Concerning tutorial organization , we hope that our tutorial will connect researchers from different cultural backgrounds and research fields .
We also note that two out of five tutorial presenters are female , and the pool of presenters offers a mix of more junior and experienced presenters .

Conversational AI and ( components of ) T O D systems have been taught in several tutorials in past years , where the focus has been put on diverse aspects such as : deep learning techniques for T O D ( Chen et al. , ACL 2017 ; Su et al. , NAACL - HLT 2018 ; Gao et al. , ACL 2018 ) , data collection and end - to - end learning ( Wen et al. , EMNLP 2019 ) , or NLG methods ( Ji et al. , EMNLP 2020 ) and their evaluation ( Khapra and Sai , NAACL - HLT 2021 ) .
However , our tutorial is the first to focus on the crucial aspects of multilingualism and low - resource languages in relation to the design , development , evaluation , and application of ( multilingual ) T O D systems .
Our tutorial offers a completely novel and unique perspective to T O D also through the optics of multilingual NLP .

Web : sites.google.com/ Ethical Considerations .
T O D systems can and should be used for greater good , but their use also comes with potential harmful implications .
As part of the tutorial , we will therefore also point to guidelines and required ethical standards related to T O Doriented data collection and ( user - centered ) evaluation , and also provide an overview of potential threats in current T O D - oriented models ( e.g. , gender , race or religion biases ( Barikeri et al. , 2021 ) ) .
Furthermore , we will remind NLP researchers and practitioners to bear in mind potential data- and model - centered biases , and apply appropriate data filtering and debiasing techniques before deploying T O D systems in real - world settings .
