Third , the growing popularity of promptbased methods ( Liu et al. , 2021 ) has resulted in a new paradigm for training and fine - tuning Large Language Models ( LLM ) as well as novel applications in Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) ( Liu et al. , 2022 ) .
NER for historical texts has been the focus of a growing body of research , most recently surveyed by Ehrmann et al. ( 2021 ) .
Both NER and the related task of Entity Linking can enhance our ability to search and navigate digitised historical materials ( Neudecker et al. , 2014 ; Kim and Cassidy , 2015 ) .
However , applying NER to historical texts poses a number of challenges , including those due to errors in Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) ( Ehrmann et al. , 2021 ; Hamdi et al. , 2019 ; Boros et al. , 2020 ) and domain transfer ( Baptiste et al. , 2021 ) .
To advance research in this area , an increasing number of datasets have been created to support the development and evaluation of NER approaches in historical text ( Neudecker , 2016 ; Ehrmann et al. , 2020 , 2022 )
In this paper , we examine the zero - shot abilities of T0 — a prompt - based LLM developed as part of the BigScience project for open research ( Sanh et al. , 2021)—on the challenging task of historical NER2 .
This endeavour had two main hurdles : ( 1 ) the model was neither trained to recognize entities , nor was it ever tested on that task ; ( 2 ) our In this work , we explore whether the recently demonstrated zero - shot abilities of the T0 model extend to Named Entity Recognition for out - of - distribution languages and time periods .
Using a historical newspaper corpus in 3 languages as test - bed , we use prompts to extract possible named entities .
Our results show that a naive approach for prompt - based zero - shot multilingual Named Entity Recognition is errorprone , but highlights the potential of such an approach for historical languages lacking labeled datasets .
Moreover , we also find that T0 - like models can be probed to predict the publication date and language of a document , which could be very relevant for the study of historical texts * .
1 Enrique Manjavacas Leiden University , Leiden , The Netherlands Introduction
This paper lies at the focal point of three orthogonal advances .
First , the recent surge in GLAM1 -led digitisation efforts ( Terras , 2011 ) , open citizen science ( Haklay et al. , 2021 ) and the expansive commodification of data ( Hey and Trefethen , 2003 ) , have enabled a new mode of historical inquiry that capitalises on the ‘ big data of the past ’ ( Kaplan and Di Lenardo , 2017 ) .
Second , the 2017 breakthrough that was the transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) has led to the so - called ImageNet moment of Natural Language Processing ( Ruder , 2018 ) and brought about unprecedented progress *

To better contextualize the results of our experiments , we also run zero - shot prompt - based probing ( Zhong et al. , 2021 ) to assess T0 ’s broader ability of extracting factual knowledge about two key factors in our experiment , that is , language variation and historical variation in the dataset .
modeling objective.7 Crucially , this pretraining is done using a prompt - based training setup , in which training examples are transformed into prompts using a variety of crowd - sourced prompt templates .
This setup allows T0 to perform few - shot and zeroshot learning when presented with new prompts for a previously unseen task .

Our goal in this paper is to see if and how state - ofthe - art language models can be used for historical NLP tasks , with minimal modifications and finetuning.8 As such , we choose to use a ‘ naive ’ approach , by directly asking the model which named entities a given sentence contains .
To do so , we first design prompts for each named entity type ( see Table 2 ) .
For each sentence in the dataset , we then 1 ) use all the generation prompts to determine if the sentence contains named entities of each entity type 9 ; 2 ) filter the model ’s answer to keep only tokens that are actually in the input sentence , keeping the entity covering the longer span in case of nested entities ; and 3 ) ask a disambiguation question if needed ( if a token was assigned to multiple entities by the model ) .
Results are stored at each step .
We then evaluate the results and conduct two additional experiments to better understand the impact of the dataset language and time period on the performance of the LM . 2.3 Experimental setup 2.1 Data description Our data comes from version 1.4 of the CLEFHIPE3 2020 open - access dataset4 : an OCR’ed newspaper corpus annotated for NER ( Ehrmann et al. , 2020 ) .
It contains Swiss and Luxembourgish newspapers from 1790 to 2010 , in English , German and French .
For our experiment , we use only entities of coarse type , according to their literal sense .
Coarse entity types in the CLEF - HIPE 2020 dataset are persons , locations , organizations , dates and products ( which includes media and doctrines ) .
We mix the original training and validation sets to constitute our test set5 , and we split this new set by language and date ( using 20 years time intervals,6
see Table 1 ) .
Each language dataset is relatively balanced between 1810 and 1910 , with English containing between 2,202 and 4,697 tokens per split with the exception of one split ( 1850 - 1870 English ) for which there are no tokens .
German contains between 6,735 and 12,829 tokens , and French contains between 8,550 and 16,874 tokens .
The end periods contain on average more tokens for German and French .
Overall , the dataset contains 3.8 % of named entities ( from 1.9 to 5.6 % , depending on time periods and datasets ) .
The most balanced dataset across time periods is the French one ( between 3.8 and 4.6 % named entities ) .
In our experiments , we use the T0++ variant of the T0 language model ( Sanh et al. , 2021 ) , based on the LM - adapted T5 model ( Lester et al. , 2021 ) , itself a variant of the T5 model ( Raffel et al. , 2020 ) , which further pretrains the original encoder - decoder architecture of T5 with an autoregressive language Results 3.1 Limitations 7
The added specific pretraining of T0 uses a set of 11 varied tasks represented by a total of 55 datasets .
8 Ecological concerns and funding inequalities raise considerations on how to best use already existing models for lower - resourced tasks , and with spending as little further computing power in fine - tuning as possible ( Bender et al. , 2021 ) .

For PROD entities , the generation prompt explicitly mentioned media and doctrines , as we regarded the word product as too generic to return an accurate answer from T0 .
3 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum Identifying Historical People , Places and other Entities .
5 3 Results reveal limitations in our proposed approach .
First , T0 exhibits a clear tendency to produce nonempty outputs regardless of the presence or absence of named entities in the input : none of the prompts generates an empty answer .
This is especially visible for the entity PROD , for which T0 answers over 55 % of the queries with the name of the entity itself ( e.g. either media or doctrine ) rather than with any other token from the input sentence .
Second , adequately matching T0 ’s output with tokens in the input sentence proved difficult .
Even when T0 generates an answer semantically very close 2.2 Model description 4 Experiments https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020 For English , we use only the validation set , as the training set is absent 6
We chose 20 - year spans as the smallest time range producing somewhat balanced splits .

tokens using normalized Levenshtein distance,11 using this metric as a proxy to identify best predictions for each entity query in each sentence .
For a given example , we define ( 1 ) the true positive as the prediction with the shortest Levenshtein distance from the gold ; ( 2 ) false positives as predictions of entities that are not actually present in the input sentence ; and ( 3 ) false negatives as predictions that have longer Levenshtein distance to the gold tokens ( i.e. predictions that would have failed to identify entity tokens in the sentence ) .
Precision and F1score are relatively low , especially for PROD entities , which were the most difficult to define in terms of text prompts .
Higher values for recall are due to the fact that increasing the Levenshtein threshold makes it more likely to find an acceptable answer among those generated by T0 .
Unsurprisingly , the highest increase is found in TIME entities ( dates have fixed formats , which makes it more likely to find an acceptable distance between predictions and correct tokens ) .
Precision scores for each entity type are shown in Figure 1 ( see Fig . 3 in Appendix for recall and F1 - score ) .
The results of our experiment suggest that , although T0 struggles to return to the correct token in the sentence , differences in spelling prevent the algorithm from correctly associating T0 ’s answer with said token in the input sentence .
This problem is inherent to the nature of our dataset : frequent OCR errors generate unpredictable variations in ‘ gold ’ word spelling ( including spacing between words and letters or diacritics variation ) , which are automatically corrected by T0 during its predictions,10 which negatively affects our ability to automatically match its answers with corresponding tokens in the sentence .
In other instances , the model translated words from French and German into English .
Further experiments might need to mitigate language variety by adding input text to the prompt , to help the model correctly assess the language in which it must answer .
As all answers predicted are considered strictly incorrect , the algorithm never enters its disambiguation phase .
We therefore analyse non disambiguated results .
3.2 Evaluation To evaluate proximity between predictions and gold , we compare ‘ gold ’ tokens with predicted 11 Normalization was done with regard to the length of the longest token ( predicted or correct ) , and results were kept below a threshold .
We tried 0.0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 .

Languages are distinguished by both the line color and the type of dot . 2020 evaluation campaign13 confirms that our implementation of zero - shot NER with T0 is below SOTA performance .
As baselines , we considered the micro precision , recall and F1 - score of coarse NER ( literal sense ) with fuzzy boundary matching from HIPE 2020 ( see Table 3 ) .
exact matches of the entities in the input sentence , it is still capable of generating answers that are semantically close to the correct tokens .
After manually inspecting the dataset and its numerous OCR artifacts , we choose 0.4 as a reasonable heuristic of close semantic similarity between T0 ’s output and gold tokens .
We find that using a threshold of 0.4 prevents the apparition of false positives , and therefore we use it to analyze differences between languages and between historical periods within the dataset .
With respect to variations across languages , we observe that the precision of predictions in English does not have a clear edge over precision in French and German ( Fig . 2 ; see also Fig . 4 in Appendix ) .
This is unexpected , as T0 should display considerable bias towards English , which constitutes most of its training data .
With respect to variations across periods , we observe an improvement in precision ( and F1 - score ) for PERS and LOC entities in English texts from 1850s onwards ( Fig . 3 ; for recall and F1 - score , see Fig . 5 in Appendix ) , when for other entities and languages , precision and F1 - score are either stable or show a downward trend ( e.g. LOC in German)12 .
Variations in recall can not be reduced to clear trends , but they are particularly erratic in English texts .
A possible explanation could be that T0 is more sensitive to English text inputs , and therefore outputs a higher or lower number of irrelevant answers based on the specific content of each input sentence .
Languages English German French Precision Recall F1 - score 0.794 0.870 0.912 0.817 0.886 0.931 0.806 0.878 0.921 Table 3 : HIPE 2020 ’s best results for coarse NER ( literal ) with fuzzy boundary .
All the scores from our experiments with T0 are below the best results from HIPE 2020 .
We note that the results from HIPE 2020 are based on experiments conducted on the HIPE test sets in each language ( these are different from the test sets we used in our experiments , for which we combined the original HIPE training and validation sets ; see Sec . 2.1 ) .
For this reason , we re - run our experiments on the original HIPE test sets , keeping the threshold for Levenshtein distance at 0.4 .
We observe no significant improvement in precision and F1 - score compared to the results of our experiments on the combined training and validation sets .
We observe some improvements in recall , especially for English and for TIME , with recall reaching 1.0 for some combinations of language , entity and time period .
However , we believe that Baseline comparison with the results of the HIPE 13 https://github.com/impresso/CLEF-HIPE-2020/ blob / master / evaluation - results / ranking_summary _ final.md 12 The absence of documents in the 1850 - 1870 English split explains the missing values for English in that period .
78  this improvement is not significant and it is due to our choice of the Levenshtein threshold , as already explained above .
4 diction of language and publication date of historical texts .
Our results show that historical texts present additional challenges for zero - shot NER ( especially because historical datasets often include noisy OCR ) , but that T0 can however be used as is for language and date prediction .
Next steps will be experimenting on different prompts and matching methods , as well as testing few - shot NER .
Prompt - based factual probing In addition to our main experiment on NER , we run two further experiments to assess T0 ’s ability to do inference in a multilingual setting and to identify historical variation in textual corpora .
Acknowledgements Probing for language To gauge T0 ’s ability to reason in a multilingual setting , we test the model ’s language identification ability .
To that end , we use a trilingual14 subset of the WiLI-2018 - Wikipedia Language Identification dataset ( Thoma , 2018 ) and prompt the model on language ( Table 2 ) .
We find that the model is able to correctly classify 83 % of French sentences , 74.1 % of German sentences , but only 35.4 % of English sentences .
The previously mentioned potential sensitivity of the model to its own mother tongue might explain this result .
This work took place under the umbrella of the “ Language Models for Historical Texts ” working group of the BigScience “ Summer of Language Models 21 ” workshop15 .
We are thankful to the organizers of this workshop for providing a forum conducive to collaborative and open scientific inquiry .
We are especially grateful to Suzana Ilić for her help setting up and organising the working group .
Probing for publication date To assess T0 ’s treatment of historical text , we study how well it predicts the likely date of publication for a piece of text from our test dataset by prompting on publication date ( Table 2 ) .
In this paper , we take exploratory first steps toward instrumentalising the T0 large language model on the task of historical NER .
We deem it appropriate to briefly discuss the ethical considerations that are implied by such a usage .
First , if a model can be used in a context for which it was not explicitly intended for , it stands to reason that it can be misused in that same context : while recognizing entities in historical texts might at first glance seem innocuous , numerous studies focused on BIPOC representation in history have shown that this is not the case , as some marginalized groups tend to suffer from history erasure ( Kellow , 1999 ; Ram , 2020 ; Stanley , 2021 ) .
Second , the automation and scaling of historical inquiry could potentially lead to unreflected ( mis)interpretations of the past ( Gibbs and Owens , 2013 ; Gibbs , 2016 ) .
Third , the experimental nature of prompt - based inference could lead to a considerable carbon footprint , owing to the trial - and - error nature of manual prompt calibration , though this cost would still be lower than training a new model from scratch or fine - tuning an existing LLM ( see footnote 8) .
Languages Absolute errors Mean Median English German French 40.48 40.11 55.25 Broader Impacts Statement 30.0 32.0 48.0 Table 4 : Date prediction results .
Table 4 shows the prediction errors .
Subtle language change can occur in a measurable way in as short a period as a decade ( Juola , 2003 ) , and therefore a median absolute error of 30 suggests that T0 is good in predicting publication dates .
We notice some variation in performance between different languages , with French performing slightly worse on both metrics ( possibly because it belongs to a different language family from English , contrary to German ) .
