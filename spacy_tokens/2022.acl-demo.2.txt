Abstract Recent advances in NLP and information retrieval have given rise to a diverse set of question answering tasks that are of different formats ( e.g. , extractive , abstractive ) , require different model architectures ( e.g. , generative , discriminative ) , and setups ( e.g. , with or without retrieval ) .
Despite having a large number of powerful , specialized QA pipelines ( which we refer to as Skills ) that consider a single domain , model or setup , there exists no framework where users can easily explore and compare such pipelines and can extend them according to their needs .
To address this issue , we present UKP - SQ UARE , an extensible online QA platform for researchers which allows users to query and analyze a large collection of modern Skills via a user - friendly web interface and integrated behavioural tests .
In addition , QA researchers can develop , manage , and share their custom
Skills using our microservices that support a wide range of models ( Transformers , Adapters , ONNX ) , datastores and retrieval techniques ( e.g. , sparse and dense ) .
UKP - SQ UARE is available on https://square.ukp - lab.de.1 1 Figure 1 : QA page of UKP - SQ UARE .
The user selects a Skill ( in this case , two open - domain Skills are selected ) , enters a question and then receives an answer .
( i.e. , finding the answer span in a context ) and abstractive ( Kocisky et al. , 2018 ) ( i.e. , generating an answer that is not a contiguous span in the context ) .
The format may influence the model architecture ( e.g. , discriminative objective for multiple choice , generative objective for abstractive ) .
Additionally , systems vary with how the context is provided .
It can be given by the user , or retrieved from a Datastore which is commonly referred to as open - domain or retriever - reader setup ( Chen et al. , 2017 ) .
The retrieval mechanism can also be chosen from a set of sparse ( e.g. , BM25 , Robertson et al. , 1994 ) or dense ( e.g. , DPR , Karpukhin et al. , 2020 ) techniques .
Introduction Researchers in NLP have devoted significant resources to creating more powerful machine learning models for Question Answering ( QA ) , and collecting high - quality QA datasets .
Combined with the recent breakthroughs by large pretrained language models , we have witnessed rapid progress in the field across many different kinds of QA tasks ( Rogers et al. , 2021 ) .
The great variety in QA tasks has led to specialized , domain - specific models trained on a single QA format such as multiple choice ( Lai et al. , 2017 ) ( i.e. , selecting the best answer out of multiple options ) , extractive ( Rajpurkar et al. , 2016 )
The speed of progress in the field makes it essential for researchers to explore , compare , and combine these different QA components as quickly as possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses 1

( 1 ) First a user selects a Skill and issues a query via the User Interface .
( 2 ) The selected QA Skill forwards the query to the respective Datastore for document retrieval .
( 3 ) The Datastore gets the query embedding from the Models , uses it for semantic document retrieval and returns the top documents to the Skill .
( 4 ) The Skill sends the query and retrieved documents to the reader model for answer extraction .
( 5 ) Finally , the answers are shown to the user .
( 6 ) Optionally , the user can view the results of the predefined behavioural tests for the Skill .
major components are Skills , Datastores , Models , Explainability and the User Interface .
The process flow across the components is illustrated in Fig . 2 on an open - domain , extractive QA Skill .
The central component of the system is the Skill that specifies how a user query is processed ( e.g. , which QA type , retrieval mechanism , model or adapter to be used in which order ) .
The Skill leverages the other services for query execution .
Datastores hold multiple collections of documents with sparse indices , e.g. , BM25 ( Robertson et al. , 1994 ) and dense indices , e.g. , DPR ( Karpukhin et al. , 2020 ) , allowing fast and efficient retrieval of background knowledge in an extensible way .
The Model service hosts numerous models , combined with Adapters ( Houlsby et al. , 2019 ; Pfeiffer et al. , 2020 ) , to support a wide range of tasks such as text embedding ( for queries in opendomain QA ) , sequence and token classification ( for multiple - choice and extractive QA ) and sequenceto - sequence generation ( for abstractive QA ) .
The Explainability component performs behavioural tests on the deployed Skills for better understanding of the models .
Details of each service are provided in the following sections .
of the current state of the art .
Even though there exists a number of powerful QA systems ( Dibia , 2020 ; Khashabi et al. , 2020 ) and frameworks such as Haystack,2 those approaches focus only on one component ( e.g. , retrieval , QA format , domain ) , hence do not allow plug - and - play of different Datastores , domains , model architectures or retrieval techniques .
This considerably limits their applicability and reusability across the diverse , rapidly progressing area of QA research , making it infeasible for researchers to quickly integrate novel models and QA pipelines .
To address this gap , we introduce UKPSQ UARE , a flexible and extensible QA platform to enable users to easily implement , manage and share their custom QA pipelines , which we call Skills , using our microservices .
As shown in Fig . 1 , UKPSQ UARE also allows users to query and compare different Skills via an easy - to - use user interface and systematically analyze their strengths and weaknesses through integrated behavioural tests.3 2 UKP - SQ UARE
The system is implemented as a modern microservice architecture using Docker containers.4 The Furthermore , while we host UKP - SQ UARE on our infrastructure and make it available for the community , we also provide the option to set up the system locally .
Additionally , the Datastores and 2 https://deepset.ai/haystack 3 Screenshots for adding Skills , the outputs of different QA formats and behavioural tests are shown in Appendix D. 4 https://docker.com 10  Models services are exposed via an API5 .
els provided on our platform .
The Models component comprises of two main services : inference and management .
The inference service is responsible for loading models and getting predictions for the input queries .
The management service allows the user to list , deploy , update and remove models ( available on HF , Adapterhub and Sentence - Transformers ) on the UKP - SQ UARE platform .
This allows to deploy and query models beyond the ones we already provide , for example multilingual models .
To maintain a scalable architecture , we host every deployed model in its separate Docker container and use Traefik7 to route the user query to the specific model instance for inference .
The inference service of the model API can be queried using the Skills ( § 2.1 ) as per the end - user ’s requirements .
2.1 Skills Skills define how the user query should be processed by the Datastores and Models components and how the respective answers are obtained .
For question answering , this might involve retrieving background knowledge , extracting spans from context or selecting an answer from multiple choices .
Skills are not necessarily equivalent to a model trained on a dataset .
Instead a Skill is more general and can use multiple models to arrive at an output .
A Skill might work on a specialized domain ( e.g. biomedical , movies , etc . ) or a specific format ( e.g. extractive , abstractive , etc . ) , but also combinations are possible .
For example , a Skill could combine Wikipedia and a news based extractive reader model to answer factoid and news questions .
The degree of specialization or generalization of a Skill is up to its developer .
In UKPSQ UARE the Skill only defines the pipeline , i.e. , pre - processing , information retrieval or answer extraction / generation / classification .
These steps are facilitated and executed by the usage of the other components : Models ( § 2.2 ) and Datastores ( § 2.3 ) .
Importantly , Skills can be added to the system by the community .
They can be added privately , thereby only giving a specific user access to it , or made public , allowing everyone to use it ( § 3.1 ) .
This allows great flexibility in the design of question answering pipelines , keeping implementation effort and required compute low , thereby democratizing the usage of question answering models .
2.3 Datastores The Datastores are responsible for storing document collections as knowledge bases of QA Skills , supporting retrieval on these collections .
Each Datastore contains a collection of documents and several indices of them for retrieval .
The document collections are stored by an Elasticsearch8 instance .
Within one Datastore , the document collection is indexed by sparse or dense retrieval models .
For sparse retrieval , we use BM25 provided by the Elasticsearch instance ; for dense retrieval , we use dual - encoder neural networks ( Karpukhin et al. , 2020 ; Xiong et al. , 2021 ) with Approximate Nearest Neighbor ( ANN ) indexing provided by Faiss ( Johnson et al. , 2021 ) .
The Datastores are agnostic to the ANN methods .
Among them , we use IndexIVFScalarQuantizer ( Jégou et al. , 2011 ) from Faiss as the default choice .
For scalability , we maintain each dense - retrieval index within one Docker container and use Traefik to route the queries to the specific index .
For each query using dense retrieval , the Datastores forward the query to the Models to get the query embedding ( e.g. , via the Query Embedder in Fig . 2 and Table 2 ) and then input this embedding to the ANN search for retrieving relevant documents .
As the built - in Datastores , Wikipedia9 with the DPR encoder ( Karpukhin et al. , 2020 ) , PubMed10 2.2 Models The Models component is responsible for hosting NLP models required for document retrieval and answer extraction / generation tasks .
Our platform supports a wide variety of models comprising HuggingFace ( HF ) Transformers ( Wolf et al. , 2020 ) , Adapters , Sentence - Transformers ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ) , and a limited selection of ONNX ( Open Neural Network Exchange ) ( Bai et al. , 2019 ) models .
Specifically , the inclusion of memory - efficient adapters in our platform allows having a variety of task - specific models while maintaining storage efficiency .
Moreover , for faster inference , the high performance inference engine , ONNX Runtime6 can be used for the ONNX mod 7 https://traefik.io https://elastic.co 9 The English Wikipedia dump preprocessed by Karpukhin et al. ( 2020 ) .

Recently , many interpretability techniques to understand black - box neural models such as influence functions and input / token attribution methods ( Madsen et al. , 2021 ) have been introduced .
Most of these techniques provide only local explanations and require access to the back - propagation function .
One exception is CheckList ( Ribeiro et al. , 2020 ) , which is a type of behavioural testing that treats models — in our case Skills — as black - boxes and compares their behaviour against the expected one .
This is achieved by unit tests designed by the end - users or the system experts .
Two most common test types are Minimum Functionality Test ( MFT ) and INVariance ( INV ) as shown in Table 1 .
MFTs are designed to measure a capability ( e.g. , Taxonomy capacity of matching object properties to categories ) via specifying the expected behaviour ( e.g. , “ tiny ” in Table 1 ) .
INVs tests are similarly refined for capabilities ( e.g. , robustness under spelling errors in question ) , however the expected behaviour is already known , i.e. , the answer should remain the same .
We adapt the machine comprehension tests from Ribeiro et al. ( 2020 ) for behavioural testing of our Skills .
In our current setup , the tests for all the deployed Skills are curated manually , saved in as JSON file and made available via the UI .
The test results are shown on demand via a separate tab ( § 3.3 ) .

searchers .
Once a Skill has been created by a user ( § 3.1 ) it can be added , edited , and deleted in the Skill management section of the application in the “ My Skills ” menu .
For each Skill , its URL , metadata , requirements for context , and visibility can be adjusted ( see Appendix Fig . 3 ) .
The functionality of the user interface is split into QA and explainability .
QA Interface .
The QA section of the user interface provides access to the Skill by allowing the user to enter their question and optionally a context .
Public Skills are accessible to everyone while private Skills require the user to be signed in .
The UI provides distinct visualizations depending on the selected Skill type .
For extractive Skills , e.g. , SQuAD ( Rajpurkar et al. , 2016 ) , a document and multiple spans are returned and ranked by the model ’s confidence .
In this setup , we also provide the option to show the span highlighted in its position in the document ( see Fig . 1 ) .
Categorical Skills , e.g. , BoolQ ( Clark et al. , 2019 ) , show an interface with boolean output scores ( see Appendix Fig . 5 ) .
A multiple - choice Skill requires multiple options separated by newlines in the context field .
These are then ranked and returned with their 2.5 User Interface We host UKP - SQ UARE as a web application built with VueJS12 to make it easily accessible to re12 Query Embedder ( Retrieval ) Natural Questions ( Kwiatkowski et al. , 2019 ) MS MARCO

then be added to the system upon a code review .
While processing the submitted Skill requires a human in the loop , this option simplifies the hosting process for the Skill developer .
( 2 ) Second , in order to provide an option to make Skills instantly and independently available , we also allow Skills to be hosted on third party cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services , Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure .
All these cloud providers allow to easily host a lightweight function that can be used by UKP - SQ UARE .
( 3 ) Lastly , we allow developers to host Skills on their own hardware .
The only requirement is that the Skill needs to be publicly accessible .
In the latter two cases , developers will still have access to UKP - SQ UARE ’s components ( e.g. , Datastores and Models ) , but the Skill itself will run on the cloud or on other hardware .
For quick development of Skills we recommend using options ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .
For long - term availability and usage of a Skill , adding it via the public github repository is recommended .
We provide extensive documentation for all possibilities to host Skills.13 Explainability Interface .
A Skill selector is provided at the top which allows users to visualize and compare the results of the CheckList machine reading tests for the selected Skills .
A list of tests with their name , type , capability , and failure rate is shown .
The list can be expanded for a detailed description along with a small number of failed examples with their questions , context , and predictions .
3 Use Cases 3.1 Skill Publishing A major contribution of our platform is to support developers creating their own Skills .
This allows practitioners to easily make their research publicly available , without having to take care of engineering heavy topics such as infrastructure , web development and security .
To publish a new Skill , developers need to implement a single function that defines the question answering pipeline .
They are provided with utility functions that facilitate interacting with other components such as the Datastores , Models and the UI .
A code snippet implementing a Skill is given in Appendix A.
Allowing developers to implement their own Skills enables us to greatly extend the system to have stronger models .
For instance , multiple Datastores with potentially different retrieval methods can be combined to find complementary background knowledge , e.g. , from Wikipedia and biomedical articles .
Similarly , different models could be used to precisely answer a diverse set of questions that might require different capabilities , such as answerability ( Rajpurkar et al. , 2018 ) , numerical ( Dua et al. , 2019 ) or multi - hop ( Yang et al. , 2018 ) reasoning .
Once a developer creates their Skill , it can be added to UKP - SQ UARE via the UI .
The Skill developer can further make the Skill publicly available .
Allowing the community to implement Skills comes with a technical challenge such as deploying unreliable code on our servers .
We therefore allow three different ways of hosting Skills .
( 1 ) First , Skills can be hosted directly on UKP - SQ UARE .
For this , a pull request for the new Skill should be submitted to our public repository , which can 3.2 Skill Querying Once a developer makes their Skill public in UKPSQ UARE , other users can obtain answers from it .
Upon release of the system , we make a wide range of question answering Skills available .
These span over different QA formats ( extractive , multiplechoice , abstractive ) , setups ( open - domain , machine reading comprehension ) and to different domains ( wikipedia , web , biomedical , etc . ) .
The list of available models for different formats is given in Table 2 .
This allows the public to test current state - of - the - art question answering models .
Moreover , researchers can use it for qualitative analysis , for example to discover potentials biases , strengths or weaknesses in models by behavioural testing .
Furthermore , we support querying multiple Skills at the same time .
This is particularly useful to compare capabilities of different models .
For example see Fig . 1 , where two open domain , extractive Skills can be compared .
3.3 Behavioural Testing of Skills The users can choose the Skill they want to investigate from the drop - down menu .
The selected Skill can be analyzed standalone or alongside two different compatible Skills .
The tests are displayed showing the Skill fail13 13 https://square.ukp-lab.de/docs/  Supported Models Retrieval QA Types Expl .

An examplary visualization for negation and coreference testing of SQuAD Skills is given in Appendix Fig . 4 .
For replacement tests , e.g. , where names are perturbed , colored markers are used to highlight how the input was modified for the test .
This allows the user to quickly identify changes the Skill could not handle .
To analyze or process a Skill ’s test performance in more detail , a full JSON report of all test examples can be downloaded .
4 Related Work A qualitative comparison with similar frameworks is given in Table 3 .
The closest work to ours is Haystack , which is an open - source and scalable framework for building search systems over large document collections .
Although it supports both sparse and dense retrieval techniques , models from the Huggingface ( HF ) , and different QA types ( abstractive and extractive ) it lacks support for faster ONNX or memory efficient adapter models .
Furthermore , it has to be set up by the users on their own infrastructure which requires technical expertise and sufficient hardware resources .
Dibia ( 2020 ) introduce NeuralQA , an interactive tool for QA that leverages the benefits of sparse retrieval along with the HF reader models .
However , NeuralQA is limited to extractive QA .
Karpukhin et al. ( 2020 ) provide a simple user interface that employs efficient dense retrieval but only support models for opendomain QA .
Finally , UnifiedQA ( Khashabi et al. , 2020 ) provides a demo page14 that employs a custom T5 based model trained on a wide range of QA datasets , hence supports a variety of QA formats .
However , ( 1 ) it lacks the retrieval component , ( 2 ) is not scalable ( to include different model formats ) , and ( 3 ) is not flexible ( not possible to use models with different retrieval techniques ) .
Unlike other previous systems , UKP - SQ UARE is dynamically extendable allowing users to easily contribute with new Skills .
Finally , except from gradient - based explanations in Dibia ( 2020 ) , none of the systems have an explainability component .
User Study We evaluate the usability of our system by conducting a pilot attitudinal user study with five participants .
We recruited graduate students , our main target user group , and instructed them to compare and analyze several Skills .
We provided them with a list of predefined questions to input into the system to help them use it .
After the students used the system we asked them several questions to discover whether they understood every element of the interface effortlessly ( i.e. , the input and the output of the Skills , the list of behavioral cards of the Skills , and their specific contents ) .
All users understood the input and output of the Skills and stated that the interface allows them to compare the Skills effortlessly .
They also stated that the behavioral cards of the explainability component are useful to analyze the strong and weak points of the models and could help develop new Skills .
However , most of them could not understand them in a glimpse .
Hence , we will improve the presentation of these cards in a future update .
Appendix C provides the list of questions and responses .
To finish the study , we employed the System Usability Scale ( SUS ) questionnaire ( Brooke , 1996 ) to quantitatively assess the global usability of the system .
The average score is 70 out of 100 , which refers to a “ good usability " ( UIUX - Trend , 2021 ) .
6 Conclusion and Future Work
We introduce the UKP - SQ UARE platform that enables researchers and developers to study and compare QA pipelines , i.e. , Skills , that comprises a selection of Datastores , retrieval mechanisms and reader models .
The platform enables querying ex14 14 https://unifiedqa.apps.allenai.org/  isting public Skills , as well as implementing custom ones using UKP - SQ UARE ’s microservices and utility functions that support a large collection of model types and Datastores .
Furthermore , users can simultaneously query multiple Skills , and analyze them through integrated behavioural tests .
Our architecture is scalable and flexible to incorporate most of the latest developments in the QA domain .
Future versions will include automated deployment of custom models and Datastores , automated Skill selection by incorporating previous works ( Puerto et al. , 2021 ; Geigle et al. , 2021 ) and increasing the number of supported Datastores ( e.g. , wikidata , Vrandečić and Krötzsch , 2014 ) .
We also plan to incorporate specialized models ( e.g. , using graph encoders , Ribeiro et al. , 2021 ) , structured reasoning approaches ( Yasunaga et al. , 2021 ) and interpretability techniques such as saliency maps ( Li et al. , 2016 ) .
out bias .
Nonetheless , UKP - SQ UARE includes a module for explainability that uses CheckLists ( Ribeiro et al. , 2020 ) to analyze the strong and weak points of the Skills and to detect their biases and unfair content .
Thus , we currently delegate the fairness checks to the authors of the models .
We are not held responsible for errors , false , or offensive content generated by the Skills .
Users should use them at their discretion .
Environmental Impact .
Since UKP - SQ UARE empowers the community to run publicly available Skills on the cloud , it has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions from retraining previous models to make the comparisons needed when developing new models .

Intended Use .
The intended use of UKPSQ UARE is i ) bringing different QA components together to share them as a skill with the rest of the world and ii ) the analysis of these Skills .
Our platform allows NLP practitioners to share their Skills with the community removing technical barriers such as configuration and infrastructure so that any person can reuse these models .
In addition , users can analyze the available Skills through behavioral tests and compare them thanks to a user - friendly UI .
This has a straightforward benefit for the research community ( i.e. , reproducible research and analysis of prior works ) , but also to the general public because UKP - SQ UARE allows them to run state - of - the - art models without requiring them any special hardware and hiding complex settings such as virtual environments and package management .
Potential Misuse .
Our platform makes use of Skills uploaded by the community .
However , this current version does not incorporate any mechanism to ensure that these models are fair and with15  References Event , Canada , July 11 - 15 , 2021 , pages 113–122 .

First , a set of utility classes are loaded and initialized for facilitating interaction with UKP - SQ UARE ’s Models and Datastore components ( lines 1 - 5 ) .
Next , in the predict function , the Datastores are queried for retrieval .
The Datastores component takes the user query , the datastore ( Wikipeida snapshot from Natural Questions ) and what index to use ( dense , based on DPR ) as input and returns the top documents .
From these results , the document text and respective scores are extracted ( lines 11 - 17 ) .
Subsequently , the query and the top documents are passed to an to the Models component for span extraction .
In this implementation , a BERT base model with a adapter trained on SQuAD V2.0 is used ( lines 21 - 30 ) .
Finally , the top answers are returned ( lines 32 - 36 ) .
